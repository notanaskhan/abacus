> **Rules for the agent working this task**
> - Read this whole file before doing anything. Continue from the *Handoff* section if it has content.
> - Load only the files listed under *Context to load*, plus what the plan requires.
> - Amber and red tasks: do not write code until the plan is marked approved.
> - If scope must change, **stop** and add it to *Questions for the human*.
> - Never mark `done` until every item in *Definition of done* passes.
> - Append to the *Progress log* before ending any session, even mid-task.

## Objective
Connector contract and conformance suite; fake connector serving synthetic-generator trial balances; Temporal retrieval workflow running the six pipeline stages as activities; ledger snapshots; fulfilment by rule; idempotency; replay test.

## Scope
Defined when the plan is written. Starts after TASK-009.

## Context to load
- Spec: `docs/specs/SPEC-000-walking-skeleton.md`
- ADRs: ADR-017, ADR-037, ADR-038, ADR-040, ADR-090

## Plan
- [ ] Plan approved by human (required for amber and red)
- Red task: the agent drafts the design here; the founder edits or approves it before any code, then reviews the diff line by line (founder decision 2026-10-06).

Steps: to be written when the task starts.

## Definition of done
- [ ] All listed ACs have passing tests that reference them
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Lint and format pass
- [ ] Architecture and dependency rules pass
- [ ] Full test suite passes; no tests skipped, weakened or deleted
- [ ] Security scan passes; no secrets committed
- [ ] No new dependencies, or each one approved and listed below
- [ ] Every query is tenant-scoped; every endpoint checks authorisation
- [ ] AI calls (if any) go through the gateway with limits, logging and passing evals
- [ ] Module README and relevant docs updated
- [ ] Decisions below reviewed; ADR raised where needed
