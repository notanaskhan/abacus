Journey specs (J01-J28) land here, one file per journey (`.claude/skills/journey-e2e`).
They import the harness (`../harness`, F-04-T21): `test` with a `journey` fixture whose
`journey.as(persona, path)` signs a persona in through the project's adapter and whose
`journey.step(name, run)` runs axe (serious and critical = 0) and INV-1 to INV-5 after the step.

Each spec runs in four Playwright projects: `fixture` (`make journeys`, no Docker), `fullstack`
(`make journeys-full`, against `make dev` + `make seed-demo`), and `staging` and `canary` (their
URL in `ABACUS_STAGING_URL` / `ABACUS_CANARY_URL`; hosted sign-in arrives with F-04-T22).
